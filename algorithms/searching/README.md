# Linear Search

## Description
Linear search - simplest searching algorithm. It checks each element in a list one by one until the target value is found or the list ends.

## How It Works
1. Start from the first element
2. Compare it to target
3. If it matches, return the index
4. If the list ends, return -1

## Time Complexity
- Best case: O(1)
- Worst case: O(n)
- Average case: O(n)

## Space Complexity
- O(1) (constant extra space)

## When to Use
- Small lists
- Unsorted data
- Simple implementations where performance is not critical
